Possesses practical knowledge in building pipelines in biomedical research. Proven track record of translating discovery from basic science to industry. Fluent in Mandarin & Taiwanese.
As a Computer Science PhD candidate at Emory University, my research has mainly focused on bioinformatics, computational biology and systems biology in the realm of infectious diseases. My interests include the application of 3rd generation sequencing technology to infectious disease genomics, machine learning, combining current 2nd generation sequencing RNA-seq techniques in functional genomic research, and statistical methods development for medical and genomics data. I hold a US patent for a method of rapid 3rd generation sequencing data analysis. I have published several scientific papers and presented my work at scientific conferences and symposiums.">
